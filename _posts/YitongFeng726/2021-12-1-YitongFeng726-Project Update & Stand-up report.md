My original plan:
Milestone:
Milestone 1: data clean
Drop columns and fill blanks to make data more clean and clear
Milestone 2: data analysis
Check data type, maximum, minimum price,  room orders' peak and bottom, the most popular city 
Milestone 3: data visualization
Correlation graphs, bar chart for price in different ranges, pie chart for distribution in different cities, time series analysis of room orders, wordcloud graph for high frequency of city name
Milestone 4: wrap up and presentation
Make conclusions, output ppt and prepare for presentation


I finished pmilestone11, milestone 2 and part of my milestone 3, data visualization, I have problem in changing Chinises city names into English, whcih makes my graph looks weird in horizontal axis.
