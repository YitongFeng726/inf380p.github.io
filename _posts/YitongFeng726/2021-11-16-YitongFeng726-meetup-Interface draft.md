# project progress:
I confronted with problems that I cannlt uploaded my original data set which has 20,000 data in Trinket so I deleted some unuseful colums like room_id, user_id, max/min/avg room price, and I filtered only for Jingde Village data and got 60 data at last. I also got rid of the idea of drawing time series graph for I deleted the time columns and also i tried for sometimes and failed to draw a consistent line graph. I think my milestone are not very ambitious because my data is less and it's hard for me to think about more research questions towards this project. Besides, I felt upset in writing interface draft.but I will keep on continuing my plan.
# Reflection and plan
I spent some time to learn pandas, I think the introduction(read file, print headlines, print statistics) is very simple, but writing long sentences is a little difficult for me(use function like value_counts, apply...) and I need to look at a few more examples to imitate.But I think this learning process excites me, even if my output is too simple. In general, I think my plan and my skills are matching so I can complete this final project properly. and hope I can master the skill of using apply function in next week because it still seems abstract for me and I don;t know where to utilize it sometimes.
