Project Plan
Project name: Analysis of Airbnb consumption information in China in 2017
Project Summary: Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. I once worked in airbnb and was a product operation and kept the data set at that time and I think it will be a good study case for my final project. The data set is about the  Airbnb consumption information in China in 2019, though it already collected 22,958 data, the original data set contains some unuseful data columns and I will do data cleaning process at first and mainly use column of 'order_date', 'order_price', 'room_area', 'hotel_city' to see the corelation between price and city, price and room area, and see the change of order_date over time.
I hope I can utilize the limited data to provide an overview of data visualization of Airbnb consumption and obtain some insightful findings for understanding customer decisions and guide marketing initiatives after processing data.
Graph: correlation graph, bar chart, line chart
Data source:
Tool: Google Colab

Check data type, maximum, minimum price,  room orders' peak and bottom, the most popular city 
Milestone 3: data visualization
