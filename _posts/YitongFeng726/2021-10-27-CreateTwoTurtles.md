#reflection1: it seems like a simple question in the ronestone, just draw"CS" shape by using Turtle, at first I tried to write codes step by step like just write codes as "penup and pendown",'left and right', but I think the codes looks more redundant and too long. Also, when writing codes to draw "s", i struggled about the orientation to turn left and right, so the process of deciding the orientation was quite slowï¼ˆmaybe because my Poor sense of direction. So I turned to review the runestone's tutorial and finally chose to use 2 loops, which can be regarded as shortcut.            
#Reflection2: It's hard for me to think about some situations about putting conditional statement in turtle. While using turtle to draw a star with 9 Protruding horns is a good choice, so I used for loop to traverse 20 lines and used % computation to decide its routes. A problem is I don;t know why the turtle pen repeated to draw a redundant line in the end. Also, it will be beeter if I can add codes to start at other position and draw another star and make a non-overlapping shape.
