### Description
	I would like to make a game using Turtle. I’m not 100% sure what form the game will take but I want to avoid making a clone of Asteroids. In order to make a game engaging without making it frustratingly fast paced I think I want to make a game that is more like a puzzle game or maybe a maze. The turtle will be able to move between levels to simulate traveling a longer distance than can be shown on the screen. 
	
  I’m not sure whether it would be feasible to include combat so the turtle will simply navigate a maze and might pick up items to complete the game. Perhaps keys will be needed to progress past certain points and messages will be shown on screen to inform the player of this.
  
  I'm worried that creating multiple levels with barriers (so that the turtle cannot go though walls) will take a bit of time so the game will be exploration based, not combat based.
