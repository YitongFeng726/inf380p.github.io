I have successfully gotten keyboard input to work, which is pretty exciting. To reiterate, my plan for my game is a game where two turtles run around on the screen and collect good food to win but if they eat bad food the player loses the game.
I wanted to make this a two player game, because it is based on a flash game about two dogs that my sister and I used to play a lot as kids.

I have one out of the four goals I had set up completed, but I think it may have been the easiest one.

This is my original list:
"I need to make “win” and “try again” screens (maybe have the turtle draw a word?); as well as a help/instructions screen; learn how to make a turtle react to key presses (and if I decide to do a two-turtle stage, have one react to arrow keys and the other WASD); use my own graphics for obects (learn how/if I can import them? It would be fun to have the “good” food be food(s) turtles can eat, like apples, and the “bad” food be things like candy bars)"

I have completed the keyboard input goal, but I would like to rewrite my goals

* Create boarders for the screen that the turtles cannot pass
* Create food that when hit ups a counter (make number "turtles" for the counter)
* Create food that trggers a "try again" screen (words on the screen maybe)
* Create a win screen after the food counter hits a certain number/moves player to the next level
* Create a way to get to the next level
* Import graphics for food

I don't think I will have any solid roadblocks ahead. I think that once I figure out how to make the food touch-sensitive everything will fall into place. Also, it will probably be time consuming to write out all the instructions for the turtle to write out words on the screen.
I personally think that my milestones are ambitious enough, though my only real stretch goal is importing graphics.

Before next class, I plan on having the food working, since that's the basic element of the game. I also plan on having all of the text turtles finished.

I was very, very busy this last week so it was hard for me to do more than what I managed to do. Thankfully, I should have more time in the coming weeks, so I should be able to put more time toawrd my turtle game.
